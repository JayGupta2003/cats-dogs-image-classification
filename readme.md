# Dog and Cat Image Classification with CNNs

This notebook presents a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implementation using TensorFlow and Keras for the binary classification of dog and cat images.

## Dataset

The project utilizes the "Dog and Cat Classification Dataset" available on Kaggle. This dataset comprises a substantial collection of images categorized into 'Dogs' and 'Cats' classes.

## Implementation Details

1.  **Environment Setup:** The initial cells handle the necessary library imports (TensorFlow, Keras, Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas) and configure the Kaggle API for dataset download.
2.  **Dataset Download and Extraction:** The dataset is downloaded as a zip file and extracted into the Colab environment.
3.  **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** The `image_dataset_from_directory` utility from `tf.keras.preprocessing` is employed to load the images from the 'PetImages' directory. The dataset is split into training and validation sets with a 85/15 ratio. Images are resized to 200x200 pixels.
4.  **Data Augmentation:** A `tf.keras.Sequential` model is used for on-the-fly data augmentation during training. The augmentation layers include `RandomFlip("horizontal")`, `RandomRotation(0.1)`, and `RandomZoom(0.1)`.
5.  **Model Architecture:** A sequential CNN model is constructed with the following layers:
    - Data augmentation layer.
    - `Rescaling(1./255)` for normalizing pixel values.
    - Multiple `Conv2D` layers with ReLU activation and increasing filter sizes (32, 64, 64, 128).
    - `MaxPooling2D` layers after each convolutional block for spatial downsampling.
    - `Dropout(0.2)` for regularization.
    - `Flatten` layer to convert the 2D feature maps into a 1D vector.
    - A `Dense` layer with 512 units and ReLU activation.
    - A final `Dense` layer with 1 unit and sigmoid activation for binary classification.
6.  **Model Compilation:** The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss, with 'accuracy' as the evaluation metric.
7.  **Model Training:** The model is trained for 10 epochs using the prepared training and validation datasets.
8.  **Results Visualization:** Plots are generated to visualize the training and validation loss and accuracy over the epochs.
9.  **Model Saving:** The trained model is saved in the Keras format (`model.keras`).
10. **Handling Invalid Files:** Code is included to identify and remove corrupted image files in the dataset that can cause errors during loading.

## Performance

The model achieved a validation accuracy of approximately [Insert Final Validation Accuracy]%. The training and validation curves indicate [mention observations about the curves, e.g., signs of overfitting, convergence].

## Potential Enhancements

- Explore alternative CNN architectures (e.g., VGG, ResNet).
- Implement learning rate scheduling.
- Utilize techniques like early stopping to prevent overfitting.
- Investigate transfer learning with pre-trained models on larger datasets.
- Perform a more detailed analysis of misclassified images.
